            <h2>Our priority is to choose the educational institution that will suit parents at a price and students in terms of level.</h2>
            <p>If you decide to entrust such an important choice as choosing an educational institution for us, then you are not mistaken. FINO provides professional educational consulting to students wishing to gain higher education abroad at TOP ranking universities and colleges worldwide. We are in the market since 2012. We guarantee honesty and diligence through all the process of admission and visa services.</p>
            <p> Our university consultants are fully experienced and trained by trusted university partners and the British Council, and are here to help guide you through each step of the application process to any world university, college or language school.</p>
            <h2>So why do you need us as an Educational Agent?</h2>
            <p>Today, many of those who intend to enter a foreign institution of higher education, are striving to independently go through the whole process, based on information received from the Internet. Others seek help from a specialised educational agency.</p>
            <p>What are the advantages of the second way? Or we will tell differently, what pluses, if you address to us FINO Consulting! First of all, we note that a thorough analysis and comparison of various options for admission will require a tremendous amount of time for a future student-it is simply impossible to explore this huge market in a single day or a week of hard work.</p>
            <p>No information received through the Internet or from booklets does not reflect a completely real situation with the arrival of “here and now”. An experienced consultant who works “individually”, that is, with each individual client, can prompt in time what can be waved, and what not worth trying for. He will indicate the alternatives. Strength of professional managers of educational agencies is not just knowledge of the market of educational services, but also acquaintance with specific educational institutions, their leadership, representatives of their international department.</p>

              <h2>Admission to a foreign university is a rather lengthy procedure.</h2>
              <span>The choice of the program, competent registration of documents, correspondence with the university, confirmation of enrolment, obtaining a visa – all this takes time, and not a little. The slightest failure in this chain will lead to the fact that the spent efforts will go to waste, but nobody will return the past time to the entrant. Turning to our agency, you can be sure: sad loss in the form of a missed year of study or even two will not be.</span>
                <br>
                <br>
              <span>An important advantage of applying to the educational agency is also the opportunity to optimize their expenses for training in a foreign university. Without costs in this case cannot do – it’s understandable. But here to get for your money the most useful – in other words, to spend them on the realisation of the very goal that the potential student is trying to achieve, so that the chosen program meets the strictest requirements for content and quality level – this task with the help of professionals can be solved in the most complete form. Finally, it is in our agency that you can get the latest and reliable information about the possibility of receiving a scholarship or a grant, which in the end will not only justify the costs of consulting a consultant, but will also bring some profit.</span>
                <br>
                <br>
              <span>And the last thing, if you decided to act through our agency, does not postpone your visit to us for the last months before entering. The more time you and our consultants have in stock, the more optimal variant we can find for you. Moreover, we will help you to enter this year!</span>
